-------------REPORT OF ALGORITHM EXECUTION-------------

Pattern: LOGIC

Input:
  "  I love to work in global logic!   " 

Input after removing special chars (but not spaces separating words):
I love to work in global logic

Map with (word length)|(list of words) as (key)|(value): 
Word Length: 1   |   list of words: I 
Word Length: 2   |   list of words: to in 
Word Length: 4   |   list of words: love work 
Word Length: 5   |   list of words: logic 
Word Length: 6   |   list of words: global 

Final output after executing algorithm:
OutputModel{combinationOfChars=[i], wordLength=1, occurrencesCount=1, totalOccurrences=15, frequency=0.07}
OutputModel{combinationOfChars=[i], wordLength=2, occurrencesCount=1, totalOccurrences=15, frequency=0.07}
